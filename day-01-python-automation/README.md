## 📅 Day 1 – Python for Automation

### 🔹 Focus Areas
- File handling in Python
- Exception handling using try–except–finally
- Writing automation-ready Python scripts

---

## 📂 Files in This Folder

- `file_reader.py`  
  Reads data from a text file and handles file-related exceptions.  
  (Common in log processing and automation tasks)

- `error_handling.py`  
  Demonstrates robust exception handling for runtime errors such as invalid input and division by zero.

- `sample.txt`  
  Sample input file used for file handling practice.
